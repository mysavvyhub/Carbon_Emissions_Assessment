In such cases, the IQR method is generally more appropriate because it is less sensitive to skewed data and extreme values.
* **Intensity.Accepted.Scope.3 (Green Curve):** Similar reasoning applies here. If the distribution is skewed or not bell-shaped, the IQR method would be a better choice. """)
    
    st.markdown("""

        **Why Choose IQR Over Z-Score in Skewed Distributions?**

* The Z-score method is based on the assumption of a normal distribution of data. It identifies outliers as points that are a certain number of standard deviations away from the mean. This method can be misleading if the data is not normally distributed, especially if there are skewness and extreme values, as it relies heavily on the mean and standard deviation.

* The IQR method, on the other hand, uses the median and quartiles, which are more robust to skewness and extreme values. It defines outliers based on the range between the first and third quartiles, making it more suitable for data that isn't normally distributed.

    
    So, as plotted KDE's indicate that the data for Intensity.Accepted.Scope.1.2 and/or Intensity.Accepted.Scope.3 are skewed or not normally distributed, the IQR method would be the more appropriate choice for outlier detection.

        The Carbon Emissions Dashboard, with its comprehensive array of data visualizations, underscores a pressing global narrative: a need for immediate, targeted interventions to mitigate the rising trend in carbon emissions. The increasing trajectories of 'Intensity.Accepted.Scope.1.2' and 'Intensity.Accepted.Scope.3' across sectors and countries from 2013 to 2015 highlight a universal challenge but also a differentiated one; each sector and country contributes uniquely to the global carbon footprint, with some‚Äîlike the Financials and Energy sectors, and countries like China and India‚Äîmarkedly more so.

**Conclusions:**

* **Sector-Specific Strategies:** Financials and Energy sectors demonstrate significant emission intensities, calling for industry-specific carbon reduction policies. Sectors with lower emissions should not be complacent, as their collective impact is still substantial.
* **National Emissions Management:** Countries like China and India show alarming increases in Scope 3 emissions, necessitating national strategies that target the entire value chain, from production to waste management.
* **Data-Driven Policy Making:** The strong correlation between Scope 1.2 and Scope 3 emissions suggests that policies addressing one are likely to affect the other. This interconnection should be leveraged to create holistic environmental policies.

**Recommendations:**

* **Global Collaboration:** High-emitting countries may benefit from shared technology and best practices from lower-emitting nations, fostering a collaborative approach to emission reduction.
* **Invest in Sustainability:** Investment in sustainable technologies and practices should be prioritized, especially in high-impact sectors and countries, to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation.
* **Enhance Reporting Mechanisms:** The disparities in emission intensities within the data call for improved and standardized reporting mechanisms, ensuring that data accurately reflects the environmental impact and aids in tracking progress.
* **Incentivize Green Practices:** Introduce incentives for companies and sectors that successfully reduce their carbon footprint, encouraging innovation and sustainable development.
The Carbon Emissions Dashboard serves as a crucial tool for stakeholders at all levels to comprehend the magnitude of the challenge ahead. It is imperative that this data informs not just awareness but action, translating into concrete, effective strategies and policies that can steer global industries and nations towards a more sustainable future.
